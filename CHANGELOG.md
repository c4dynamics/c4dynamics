# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- `car_tracker` notebook: the Colab install cell now runs
  `pip install "c4dynamics[vision]"` ("Darknet importer has been
  removed" when initializing `yolov3`).
- `car_tracker` notebook: `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` in both main loops is
  now skipped on Colab (unconditional call raised
  `error: ... The function is not implemented)

### Changed
- Removed the hardcoded `font.family` / `fontname = 'Times New Roman'`
  plot styling from the example modules. plots now use matplotlib's default font everywhere.
- Updated the 'hit-ground' warning in quad_pid.py to follow height criteria rather than times. 


## [2.4.3] - 2026-09-04
### Changed
- `c4dynamics.sensors.navigation.magnetometer` is now a full 3-axis device.
  `measure()` returns the body-frame geomagnetic field vector
  `[mx, my, mz]`.
  **Breaking**: callers that read `magnetometer.measure(x)[0]` as a yaw
  angle must switch to the vector form (or recover heading from the
  horizontal components).
- `quad_ekf` use case: the EKF magnetometer update is now a nonlinear
  3-axis vector correction (`h(x) = [BI] @ mref`, numeric 3x12 Jacobian),
  replacing the linear scalar-heading update and its innovation
  yaw-wrapping.
- `quad_ekf` notebook: the Colab install cell now pins `c4dynamics>=2.4.3`,
  so the notebook (which expects the 3-axis magnetometer) cannot run
  against an older, incompatible release.


## [2.4.2] - 2026-09-03
### Fixed
- README images now render on PyPI (and any non-GitHub host): the example
  gallery thumbnails were referenced by repo-relative paths, and the logo
  and "the switch" figure by GitHub `/blob/` URLs (which serve an HTML
  page, not the image). All are now absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com`
  URLs.
- notebook figures now render on Google Colab: the `quad_ekf` and
  `setup_guide` notebooks embedded a screenshot as a cell attachment
  (`attachment:image.png`), which Colab does not support. Each is now a
  committed PNG referenced by raw URL.


## [2.4.1] - 2026-09-03
### Changed
- Python compatibility: removed the `<3.13` upper cap on `requires-python`.
  c4dynamics now supports Python 3.13 (and any later 3.x), which restores
  installation on Google Colab. CI now also runs the test suite on 3.13.
- vision dependency: pin `opencv-python<5`. OpenCV 5 removed the Darknet
  importer that the `yolov3` detector relies on; the cap keeps YOLOv3
  working on every supported Python version.
- use-case example modules now ship with the package under
  `c4dynamics.utils.use_cases` (`quad_ekf`, `ekf_config`, `iris_quadcopter`,
  `dof6_modules`). The `quad_ekf` and `dof6sim` notebooks import them
  directly instead of downloading the file from GitHub at runtime.


## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- navigation sensors: new `c4dynamics.sensors.navigation` module with `gps`,
  `imu`, and `magnetometer` models, each carrying its device error model
  (noise, bias, scale factor) plus `measure()` and `demo()` methods.
  `gps` gains an `isideal` flag to zero out noise/bias.
- quadcopter model and controller: new `c4dynamics.models` module with a
  predefined `quad` (Iris) plant, and new `c4dynamics.controllers` module
  with a cascade-PID quadcopter controller and its config.
- EKF use case: `ekf_estimation` example program - extended Kalman filter
  state estimation for a quadcopter tracking a figure-8 trajectory,
  including GPS-dropout experiments and an architecture diagram.

### Changed
- kalman/ekf: opt-in `P_jitter` covariance stabilization (symmetrize and
  floor `P` after each predict/update).
- kalman/ekf `update()`: optional chi-squared NIS `gate` to reject
  outlier measurements, plus `innov`/`hx` arguments for non-subtractive
  or nonlinear residuals. `update()` now returns `None` when the update
  is gated out or `S` is numerically singular, instead of raising.
- expanded navigation sensors documentation (concepts, API reference, and
  runnable examples under `examples/sensors`).


## [2.3.7] - 2026-07-22
### Added
- an envirorments file for abstracted plant models in learning controller.
  includes a predefined helicopter class for the learning controller example.


## [2.3.6] - 2026-03-03
### Changed
- add all use-case notebooks support for google colab.


## [2.3.5] - 2026-02-25
### Changed
- update package setup to support conda installation.


## [2.3.5] - 2026-02-04
### Changed
ruff&black code style updated to fully comply with PEP-8.


## [2.3.4] - 2026-02-02
### Changed
- separate dependencies to 3 sets: basic, vision, dev.
- fix a bug of a single numpy item assignment into the state vector.


## [2.3.3] - 2026-01-17
### Changed
- fix bug in addvars(): adjust state vector legnth with new vars.
- change P() -> dist() and V() -> vel_mag() to enable these names for user variables.


## [2.3.2] - 2025-12-02
### Changed
- supersedes 2.3.1 which was tagged without the 'v' prefix.


## [2.3.1] - 2025-12-02
### Changed
- Fix the compatible Python versions to include 3.12 (<3.13).


## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-01
### Changed
- This update replaces the behavior from the previous release, where a dtype mismatch triggered a warning.
- The State object now uses a fixed internal floating-point type (np.float64) regardless of input types during initialization or assignment.
- No warning is issued for assignments with a different type .

### Breaking
- Users can no longer preserve custom numeric dtypes inside the State object.
- All state values are stored as float64 internally.
- Code that relied on modifying the dtype of the internal state vector will no longer work.


## [2.2.0] - 2025-11-15
### Breaking
- Fix: Core `State` object assignment behavior corrected — assigning a vector
	with a mismatched `dtype` to a `State` field now updates the underlying
	backing array reliably instead of silently failing to modify internal memory.
	- Impact: Code that relied on implicit (and previously unreliable) assignments
		may now see the array updated as expected or receive a clear `TypeWarning`
		when incompatible types are provided.
	- Migration: Ensure assigned arrays match the state's dtype or use the
		provided setter helper. Example migration patterns:
		```py

		# Problematic (old behavior may have silently failed)
		s = c4d.state(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
		state.X = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype = np.float64)

		# Recommended (explicit dtype match)
		s = c4d.state(x = 0., y = 0., z = 0.) 	# initialize explicitly as float
		state.X = np.asarray([1, 2, 3], dtype=state.X.dtype)

		```
	- Rationale: Prevents silent state corruption and makes assignment
		semantics deterministic across NumPy versions and platforms.
